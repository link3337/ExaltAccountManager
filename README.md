## Bypassing "token for different machine" error
It's very rare to get this kind of error and it's still unknown why that happens, but there is a workaround implemented that will bypass this problem. 
Instead of using the generated device token from your computer, you can set the device/clientToken manually in the settings tab (3rd tab) within the application.
You want to set the clientToken that gets sent when you would open the game normally via the official launcher.

You will have to use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) to do this. You want to look for the POST request that gets sent to https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/account/verify. Check the body and look for "clientToken" copy and paste that into the textbox and save the settings.
If you can't see the request you might have to change fiddler settings to capture and decrypt HTTPS traffic. 
Fiddler -> Options -> HTTPS Tab -> Make sure that Decrypt HTTPS traffic is selected. 

Alternatively you can use a [tool](https://github.com/MaikEight/EAM-GetClientHWID) that was made by MaikEight for this kind of purpose.

## Plans
Once .NET MAUI is released this will probably see a redesign with some fancy UI.
